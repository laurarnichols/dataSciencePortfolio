# Data Science Projects
This repository contains projects that I have worked on through workshops and online classes and tutorials, developing and showcasing various skills needed to be successful as a data scientist. I am learning the various tools and skills and this portfolio will document my projects along the way.

## Contents

### Data Mining and Statistical Analysis
* [Energy, GDP, and Publishing Data by Country](https://github.com/laurarnichols/dataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/energyGDPPublishing) 
   * Clean data by removing missing fields and setting proper data types and units
   * Rename fields to match other data sets and merge 
* [Movie Lens Data](https://github.com/laurarnichols/dataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/movieLens)
   * Gain insights into data using exploratory data analysis
* [Iris Dataset](https://github.com/laurarnichols/dataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/irisLinearRegression)
   * Use SciKit linear regression to predict petal width from petal length

### Computer Vision
* [Image Processing Basics](https://github.com/laurarnichols/dataSciencePortfolio/tree/master/imageProcessingBasics)
   * Based on [this tutorial/workshop](https://datacarpentry.org/image-processing/)
   * Reviewing ifferent file types for images and metadata
   * Drawing on images using `skimage.draw`
   * Creating pixel-value histograms for both grayscale and color images
   * Applying Gaussian blurring
   * Applying thresholding to create binary image
   * Detecting edges using `skimage.feature.canny`
   * Detecting connected objects using `skimage.measure.label`
   * Combine skills from tutorial in two challenges: detecting and counting bacteria colonies and tracking average channel values in a titration video
